> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Alpha 1 — production approval is pending.** Windows builds, native/JNI tests, and local packaging have passed. Real BDS validation of this RC is blocked until network isolation is demonstrated. Windows CI with Temurin 25 has passed. Connected-client gameplay and Linux remain open. See the [complete validation report](docs/validation.md).

## ✦ Built for Bedrock. Designed for Java.

Zernyth Engine brings Java plugin development to the existing Endstone architecture. Write plugins against a public Java API while Endstone handles native integration and the original Bedrock Dedicated Server retains responsibility for worlds, gameplay, protocol processing, and transport.

The framework extends Endstone's **existing plugin manager, event infrastructure, and scheduler**. Java plugins run alongside the existing Python and C++ plugin infrastructure, within one native server process and one embedded JVM.

**Java is the plugin development layer. C++ remains the native integration layer. BDS remains the game engine.**

## 🧩 Framework capabilities

| Area | Implemented functionality |
|---|---|
| **Plugin lifecycle** | JAR discovery, manifests, dependencies, lifecycle callbacks, owner generations, and cleanup |
| **Gameplay** | Player, inventory, item, world, dimension, block, and entity APIs; native Bedrock forms |
| **Events & commands** | Native-backed events, supported synchronous cancellation, typed arguments, subcommands, permissions, and text components |
| **Task execution** | Server-thread tasks, delayed/repeating tasks, bounded asynchronous execution, virtual threads for suitable I/O, and cooperative cancellation |
| **Plugin ecosystem** | Isolated classloaders, local JAR libraries, services, YAML/JSON configuration, and plugin data directories |
| **Networking** | Read-only packet metadata, filtered listeners, priorities, immutable snapshots, and capability checks |
| **Diagnostics** | Plugin profiling, slow-listener diagnostics, task/resource information, and JVM diagnostics |
| **Developer tooling** | Java API artifact, sources, Javadocs, local Maven repository, Gradle/Maven examples, and IntelliJ-oriented template |

Implementation does not imply complete real-server validation. Native mocks and JNI integration tests cover controlled scenarios; individual gameplay paths still require a connected-client BDS test.

## 🏗️ Architecture

    Plugins[Java plugins] --> API[Zernyth Java 25 API]
    API --> JNI[Existing JNI bridge]

```

- **One JVM per process.** Plugin re-enable uses a new owner generation, plugin instance, and classloader within the existing JVM.
- **Native ownership stays native.** Public APIs do not expose raw C++ pointers; handles and thread affinity are checked by the bridge.
- **The transport stays with BDS.** Packet observations use existing Endstone hooks above the original transport. Zernyth does not introduce a NetherNet, RakNet, or WebRTC stack.
- **Lifecycle cleanup is explicit.** Listener, command, task, service, and form resources follow plugin ownership and generation boundaries.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Java** | JDK **25 LTS**, without preview features; Eclipse Temurin preferred |
| **Gradle** | **9.1 or newer**; locally validated with 9.8.2 |
| **Native build** | CMake **3.29+**, Conan 2, Ninja, and the supported platform toolchain |
| **Python** | Compatible build dependencies and an ABI matching the native Python module |
| **BDS baseline** | Separately supplied **1.26.60.6** installation |
| **Endstone basis** | **0.11.15** |

All Java modules use toolchain 25 and `options.release = 25`. Older Java runtimes are unsupported. When Temurin is unavailable, an existing JDK 25 may be selected using the documented `-PzernythJavaVendor=any` override. Local validation used Oracle JDK 25. Windows CI additionally validated Eclipse Temurin 25.0.5.

### Build, verify, install

Python distribution: **`zernyth-engine==0.9.0a1`**, command **`zernyth`**. The first wheel targets Windows x64 / CPython 3.15 and replaces `endstone` in a separate virtual environment. Do not install both packages together. See the [wheel and manual publishing guide](docs/pypi.md); no package upload has been performed in this development phase.

The [Alpha packaging report](docs/pypi-validation.md) records a successful Windows GitHub build with Temurin 25, native/JNI tests, installation and artifact verification. Package uploads use the owner-selected manual target.

1. Follow the **[build and installation guide](docs/zernyth-release-0.9.md)** to prepare the supported toolchain and existing dependency caches.
2. Build Java and native artifacts as a matching versioned set. The shared version comes from [`zernyth-version.txt`](zernyth-version.txt).
3. Run the automated checks and create the local distribution using the documented release driver.
4. Verify the archive and install into a separate versioned directory. Follow the guide for manual updates and rollback.

The documented offline workflow does not automatically download missing JDKs or dependencies. BDS and the JDK are **not bundled**.

> [!NOTE]
> `pip install endstone` installs upstream Endstone, not this Zernyth fork. Zernyth requires this fork's matching native components, Java API, and runtime artifacts.

> [!WARNING]
> Use a separate test instance, a new world, and demonstrable network isolation before BDS testing. Loopback signaling alone does not establish isolation. Archive verification and the default inspection-only launcher do not start a server.

## ☕ Build your first plugin

Start with the **[plugin development template](zernyth-plugin-template/README.md)** or the **[HelloZernyth example](java/example/README.md)**. Open the template in IntelliJ IDEA and select an installed JDK 25.

```java
package dev.example;

import dev.zernyth.api.plugin.JavaPlugin;

public final class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        getLogger().info("Hello from Zernyth Engine!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        getLogger().info("Plugin resources are shutting down.");
    }
}
```

`src/main/resources/plugin.yml`:

```yaml
name: example_plugin
version: 1.0.0
main: dev.example.ExamplePlugin
```

Use the locally generated SDK repository and declare the API as a compile-time dependency:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("../java/build/sdk-repository") }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("dev.zernyth:api:0.9.0-alpha.1")
}
```

The relative repository path above matches the template directory in this source tree; adapt it for other locations. The template includes the Java 25 toolchain configuration. Maven projects can use the same local artifact with `provided` scope; see the SDK guide and template POM. Do not bundle a second copy of the Zernyth API in a plugin JAR.

**Threading contract:** native gameplay access must obey the documented server-thread restrictions. Run suitable independent Java work asynchronously and schedule native interactions back onto the permitted thread. Cancellation is cooperative; non-cooperative tasks cannot be safely forced to terminate.

## ✅ Validation and compatibility

Current Windows CI results are recorded in the **[Alpha validation report](docs/pypi-validation.md)**. The table also retains earlier local archived-plugin and sanitizer-helper results with their respective scope.

| Validation scope | Status | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Java 25 and Windows native/Python build | **PASS** | Oracle JDK 25; Windows x64 |
| Native/JNI suite | **PASS** | **249/249** tests |
| JNI checker | **PASS** | Nine test processes; no reported checker violations |
| Python tooling and CI tests | **PASS** | **46/46** tests |
| Archived example JARs 0.2–0.8 | **PASS** | Lifecycle regression with the production JNI bridge and native mocks |
| Packaging, extracted import, SDK template | **PASS** | Local installation and offline template build |
| Handle-helper ASan/UBSan | **PASS** | Bounded helper only; not the entire core |
| Windows leak detection | **BLOCKED** | Unsupported by the installed ASan runtime |
| Real BDS lifecycle for this RC | **BLOCKED** | Network isolation not demonstrated |
| Connected-client gameplay and packet tests | **NOT TESTED** | Requires an isolated server and compatible Bedrock client |
| Eclipse Temurin 25.0.5 on Windows | **PASS** | Native/JNI tests and isolated wheel installation |
| Linux and full-core sanitizers | **NOT TESTED** | Separate validation remains open |
| CI execution | **PASS** | Manual Windows build-only run, artifact downloaded and verified |

Other BDS versions are not approved by this RC's compatibility contract. A successful mock test, import, or server startup does not establish complete gameplay compatibility. No TPS, player-capacity, or universal compatibility guarantee is made.

<details>
<summary><strong>Scope and security limitations</strong></summary>

- No complete Bukkit/Paper compatibility. The current adapter is a limited porting foundation.
- No generic raw-packet sending, modification, or cancellation in the Java networking contract.
- No native dynamic client tab-completion guarantee.
- Classloader isolation is not a process sandbox. Plugins can still impair the JVM or server process.
- JNI checks and sanitizer passes do not prove complete memory safety.
- Full-core sanitizer, platform, long-running, and real-client quality gates remain open.
